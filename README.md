This is a step-by-step tutorial showing how to add a new user account in macOS using the System Settings interface.  It includes screenshots and instructions that simulate a common help desk task—creating a standard (non-admin) user for guests, trainees, or restricted accounts


## step 📋 Prerequisites:
You must be logged into an administrator account on the Mac.

This tutorial applies to macOS Ventura and later

## Step 1: Open System Settings or system Preferences(for older versions)
Click the Apple logo () in the top-left corner of your screen.

Select System Settings or System Preferences from the dropdown menu.

## Step 2: Navigate to Users & Groups
In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on Users & Groups.

You’ll see your current account listed along with login options.

## Step 3: Unlock for Changes
Click the lock icon (🔒) in the lower-left corner of the Users & Groups panel.

Enter your administrator password to unlock user management options.

## Step 4: Add a New User
Click the Add User (➕) button near the bottom of the panel.

A new window will appear asking for account details.

## Step 5: Fill in the New User’s Information
New Account Type: Choose Standard (for most non-admin users).

Full Name: e.g., “Test User”

Account Name: Auto-fills based on the full name

Password: Enter and confirm a password for the new user

Password Hint: Optional, but recommended for accessibility

Once everything is filled in, click Create User.

## Step 6: Log In to the New Account (Optional)
Click the Apple logo () > Log Out [YourName]

On the login screen, select the new user account you just created.

Log in and walk through the macOS welcome/setup steps.
